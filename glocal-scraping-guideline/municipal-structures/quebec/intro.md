In the province of Québec, there exists a total of 1,195 incorporated communities and 103 unincorporated communities, as defined by the provincial government, within the local governance system. Additionally, the province is home to 23 Indigenous communities
(Gouvernement du Québec, n.d.).

## Incorporated Communities

General Municipal Regime in QC
```

The province operates under a two-tier municipal system, known as the General Municipal Regime of Québec, which is considered one of the most complex systems of local government in Canada. This system is divided into the local and supralocal levels. Municipalities in both levels in the province are administered by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing (French: Ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation).

### The Local Level
Within this level, Québec has a total of 1,108 local municipalities. These incorporated communities fall under the Cities and Towns Act (1977). These local municipalities can be classified into six types, although the differences in names do not reflect variations in their structure, as they function similarly. The term “city” is colloquially used to describe major urban centers like Québec City and Montreal, but it is not an official designation.

#### Classification
 The main types of local and supralocal municipalities in Québec are as follows:

#### Governance 
Municipal governance at the local level involves a mayor (French: maire/mairesse) who is elected at large, along with a council. Most local municipalities consist of a mayor and six councillors, although this number may vary based on population (Gouvernement du Québec, “Territoires non Organisés,” n.d.). Municipalities with a population exceeding 20,000 residents must be divided into electoral districts, with one councillor representing each district. If a municipality is not divided into districts, councillors are elected at large (Élections Québec, n.d.).

Apart from local municipalities, the local level of the Québec General Municipal Regime also includes two distinct governance arrangements: the agglomeration, which functions as an intermunicipal council, and the district (also known as the borough), which serves as a subdivision within a local municipality.

Districts, also known as boroughs, are separate entities from electoral districts and often encompass multiple electoral districts within them. Districts are assigned certain municipal functions, which benefit from being organized on a smaller scale. The specific functions of a district may vary across municipalities. Districts are governed by borough councils, comprising councillors from the electoral districts within the borough. However, not all local municipalities have districts, and currently, only eight local municipalities in Québec are divided into boroughs. The organization of districts is determined by each city’s charter.

Agglomerations, on the other hand, are advisory bodies rather than municipalities. They operate in parallel with municipalities and consist of several member municipalities that delegate some of their authority to the agglomeration. Agglomerations fall under the Act Respecting the Exercise of Certain Municipal Powers in Certain Urban Agglomerations (2004). The establishment of agglomerations stems from municipal reorganizations in the early 2000s, following referendums held under the Act Respecting the Consultation of Citizens Concerning the Territorial Reorganization of Certain Municipalities (2003). During this process, some large municipalities were divided into smaller ones. Agglomerations were formed to include the newly created municipalities within the territory of the former, larger municipality, aiming to preserve communities and service distribution systems. The central municipality within the territory assumes responsibility for exercising the powers of the agglomeration throughout the area. Agglomeration councils oversee the administration of common services to the member municipalities and make decisions through majority votes. Each representative on the council is allocated votes proportional to the size of their population.

### The Supralocal Level

Supralocal municipalities in Québec consist of 85 regional county municipalities and 2 metropolitan communities. This governance model addresses the need for facilitating service sharing and managing regional decisions that impact multiple municipalities.

#### Regional County Municipality (85)  
Regional county municipalities fall under the Municipal Powers Act (2005). They are composed of municipalities of various sizes. Not all local municipalities are part of a regional county municipality; those excluded perform all the functions of a regional county municipality independently.  
The municipal council of a regional county municipality comprises the mayors of each member municipality, with the head of the council being called the préfet or chief officer. The préfet can be either selected by the members from amongst themselves or elected at large.

#### Metropolitan community (2)  
There are only two metropolitan communities in Québec: the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal and the Communauté métropolitaine de Québec. These communities serve as planning and coordination bodies, providing services to member municipalities such as spatial planning, economic development, international economic promotion, artistic or cultural development, metropolitan transit guidelines, and waste management planning.  
The Montreal Metropolitan Community Council consists of 28 seats, while the Québec City Metropolitan Community Council has 17 seats. These councils primarily comprise mayors of member municipalities and various municipal councillors.

#### Elections  
Elections for local municipalities, excluding Northern, Cree, or Naskapi villages, are regulated by the Act Respecting Elections and Referendums in Municipalities. As per this act, local municipalities are responsible for conducting elections every four years on the first Sunday of November. Elections Québec supports and trains returning officers during municipal elections and maintains a register of all authorized municipal political parties and independent candidates. Municipalities with a population exceeding 20,000 on January 1 of the year preceding the election must divide their territory into electoral districts.  

Notably, Québec differs from most other provinces as it does not officially recognize municipal political parties, although a list of 140 authorized municipal political parties exists in the province.

The following table summarizes and compares the eligibility requirements for voting in a municipal election and running for municipal office in Québec:

| Eligibility Criteria                                                                 | Voting | Running for Municipal Office |

## Unincorporated Communities

Unincorporated communities, as defined by the Act Respecting Municipal Territorial Organization (1988), are categorized as non-organized territories, referred to as “territoires non organisés” in French. Within the province, there are a total of 103 such communities; however, their combined population amounts to fewer than 2,000 individuals, with a majority lacking any registered inhabitants. Consequently, the issue of local governance often does not pose an immediate concern in these cases in terms of jurisdiction.

The jurisdiction over unincorporated territories falls under the purview of their respective administrative regions, known as “régions administratives” in French. While administrative regions do not function as independent governing bodies, they bear the responsibility of overseeing regional funding, services, and economic development within their designated territories. The province consists of a total of 17 administrative regions. As per the provisions outlined in the Act Respecting Land Use Planning and Development (1979), the regional county municipality, or “municipalité régionale de comté” in French, serves as the de facto local municipality for the non-organized territories (TNO).

### Data by Statistics Canada  
The Census Profile of 2021 by Statistics Canada provides insights into various designated places within the province, totaling 120 in number. These designated places include 12 instances of Localité non constituée, 94 instances of Municipalité dissoute, and 14 instances of Retired population. It is important to note that the definition of designated places differs from that of non-organized territories, as determined by the province itself. The purpose of designated places is primarily for the presentation of census data. 

## Indigenous Communities

Breakdown of Indigenous Communities in QC
```

Within Québec’s local governance systems, there are 14 Northern Villages, 8 Cree villages, and 1 Naskapi village, all of which are Indigenous communities established through Indigenous self-government agreements. While these communities share similarities with incorporated communities in a conventional sense, they are created under different legislation than that used to incorporate standard municipalities.

### Northern Villages (14)  
Northern Villages fall under the jurisdiction of the Kativik Regional Government, which was established based on the James Bay and Northern Québec Agreement of 1975. They operate under the provisions of the Act Respecting Northern Villages and the Kativik Regional Government (1978). The James Bay and Northern Québec Agreement of 1975 was a self-government agreement signed by the Québec and Canadian governments, representatives of the Inuit and Cree, and other stakeholders. It designated land in northern Québec exclusively for the use of the Indigenous groups involved and established structures for self-governance and resource agreements. In 1978, the Naskapi Band of Schefferville joined the agreement and secured similar rights through the Northeastern Québec Agreement. The leader of a Northern Village council holds the title of mayor and is elected through a general election. Additionally, the council is composed of two to six councillors, as determined by bylaw.

### Cree villages (8)  
Similar to Northern Villages, Cree villages are established under the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement of 1975. However, they have chosen not to participate in the Kativik Regional Government and instead belong to the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee). The Cree villages operate under The Cree Villages and the Naskapi Village Act (1979). The council of the Cree Band serves as the municipality’s council, and the chief of the Cree Band acts as the mayor. At the time of writing, two additional villages, Washaw Sibi and MoCreebec, are in the process of becoming Cree villages (The Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee), 2022).

### Naskapi village (1)  
Québec is home to a single Naskapi village called Kawawachikamach, which was established based on the Northeastern Québec Agreement of 1978. It is situated adjacent to Naskapi reserved land in the region. Like Northern Villages, Kawawachikamach participates in the Kativik Regional Government. However, it is administered under The Cree Villages and the Naskapi Village Act (1979; Gouvernement du Québec, 2023a; Gouvernement du Québec, 2023b).
