# Examples

In this chapter, you’ll find a curated collection of my most enduring scripts - rewritten into Jupyter Notebooks. Each example was authored by me over the past few years; I’ll highlight the techniques that have stood the test of time and offer brief critiques on areas that could be improved.

**Expectations for Contributors at GLOCAL and Comparable Civic Organizations**

1. **Data Sources**  
   - Use Elections Canada as the primary source for voter turnout statistics and official results.  
   - Supplement with Statistics Canada data for demographics (age, education, region) to enrich analysis of youth engagement.  
   - Obtain candidate details directly from each party’s official publications or websites.

2. **Non-Partisan Presentation**  
   - Deliver all analyses and visualizations without endorsing or criticizing any political party, candidate, or ideology.  
   - Focus commentary on observed trends, challenges, and opportunities rather than policy prescriptions or partisan messaging.

3. **Data Accuracy & Integrity**  
   - Ensure datasets are up-to-date and sourced from reputable agencies.  
   - Apply systematic cleaning, validation, and verification procedures, and document every transformation for reproducibility.  
   - Where uncertainties or gaps exist, annotate them clearly rather than masking potential data issues.

4. **Tools & Technologies**  
   - **Dashboarding:** Excel, Tableau, Power BI, or custom web applications—choose based on stakeholder needs and maintainability.  
   - **Infographics:** Canva, Adobe Illustrator, or equivalent design tools, with attention to accessibility and clarity.  
   - **Analysis:** Python, R, or Excel for data wrangling, statistical modeling, and chart generation—use version control and shareable workflows.

Adhering to these standards ensures that our work remains reliable, credible, and useful to all stakeholders without introducing bias.
