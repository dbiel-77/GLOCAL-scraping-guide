# Introduction

Hello and welcome to the official GLOCAL Scraping guide. I'm Daniel Biel, the primary author and maintainer of this project - I have dedicated countless hours towards scraping, cleaning, and compiling data - losing lots of my own hair in the process, this guide is a collection of what I believe to be the most fundamental building blocks towards writing an effective script, a compilation of everything that I wish I knew when I was getting started. Whether you are a volunteer trying to learn a new skill, or a seasoned expert in search of an all-in-one information hub - I am certain that this guide will be useful to you.

In This Guide You'll Discover:
- **Initial Setup Guides**
- **A Brief Introduction to Python**
- **Practical + Interactive Examples & Snippets**
- **Tips That I Have Learned in My Experience**
- **GLOCAL's Expectations From Data Volunteers**
- ***And More***

Because this is an open-source book, you may also suggest contributions â€” whether it's fixing a typo, adding examples, or proposing new sections. All input is welcome!
