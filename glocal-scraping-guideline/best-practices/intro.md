# Scraping at GLOCAL

Hello! If you are here, you are likely a volunteer at GLOCAL taking on the legislator database construction work tracks (DE) - this involves downloading the spreadsheet template, and filling out the needed information: names, photo urls, etc. 

Before you start copying and pasting text directly from the website - you should consider setting up a python script that can do all of that for you! If you have no coding experience, this likely sounds difficult - and it can be, but I recommend starting off with [Python Basics](glocal-scraping-guideline\python\python-basics.md).
