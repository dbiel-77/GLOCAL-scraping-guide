# Municipal Data Project
Canada has approximately 3600 incorporated municipalities - each with their own elected officials: Mayors, Councillors, Reeves, etc. Our mission is to gather data on all these municipal elected officials. This is a big challenge - the information is not centrally standardized or easy to find. There is no single database or open dataset that lists every mayor and councillor in the country - at least not one that is free for the public to use, see  here. 

Completing this project will mark a major step towards increased transparency, accessibility, and civic accountability in Canada. Public servants; especially at the municipal level, play a direct and often overlooked role in shaping the everyday lives of residents. They make decisions about housing, infrastructure, transit, public safety and more. Yet, the basic information of who these people are and how to contact them is often buried, inconsistent, or outright unavailable to the public. By compiling this data in a centralized and structured way, we are not just creating a spreadsheet, we are building public infrastructure. This empowers journalists, researchers, community organizers, and everyday citizens to engage with local governance. It brings visibility to those in power and ensures they are reachable, accountable, and known. Making these names and roles findable shouldn’t be a challenge - but it is, and by solving that problem, we’re helping strengthen democracy from the ground up.

**So what are we doing?**
We are creating a csv that has information about municipal representatives across Canada - don't worry about *what* information for now - first, advance to task 1.
